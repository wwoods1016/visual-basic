Basic Visual Basic Calculator
===============================================

This code creates a basic calculator application using Visual Basic. The calculator can do basic calculator things like adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and it can also clear the display, add decimal point, and remove the last entered digit. Below I have listed some brief instructions on how I might change the appearance of the calculator using Visual Studio. 

Features
--------

-   Handles button clicks for numbers, clear, add, subtract, multiply, divide, and equals.
-   When a number button is clicked, it adds the corresponding number to the display.
-   When the clear button is clicked, it clears the display.
-   When an operation button is clicked, it stores the first number and the operation to be performed.
-   When the equals button is clicked, it performs the operation on the two numbers and displays the result.
-   The code uses a Select Case statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operation variable.
